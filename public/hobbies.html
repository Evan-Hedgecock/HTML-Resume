<h2>Basketball</h2>

<p>I love playing basketball, I grew up playing basketball with my dad all of the time. Most of middle school and through high school I played on competetive teams. I don't have as much time to play anymore, but always enjoy playing, and have amazing memories from practicing and playing games.</p>
<br>
<h2>Weight lifting</h2>

<p>Weight lifting and exercising is still very important to me, lifting weights will always be one of my favorite hobbies and something that I will stay in the habit of forever.</p>
<br>
<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>I've always enjoyed reading, from the <em>Rangers Apprentice</em> series, or Narnia (I finished the first book in a day haha), I've always been a reader. As I've grown older I've started being more interested in the self-help genre, or books relating to psychology.</p>
<br>
<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>Coding is a much more recent hobby of mine. When I was in 6th grade I took a coding class, but I really disliked the teacher and ended up failing the class. Contrary to me failing my only coding class, I've actually enjoyed manipulating data and files on computers, and actually enjoyed doing the actual work in that class. And now after watching youtube tutorials, and starting a web development bootcamp I'm hooked.</p>
